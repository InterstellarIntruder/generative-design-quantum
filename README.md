# Quantum Computing for Generative Design

This repository contains code examples and tutorials exploring the intersection of quantum computing and generative design. It accompanies a series of blog posts that introduce quantum computing concepts to artists and designers, demonstrating how this emerging technology could transform creative practices.

## Overview

Quantum computing offers possibilities for generative design and computational art. This series explores fundamental quantum concepts through practical examples, making quantum computing accessible to creative practitioners.

## Blog Posts & Tutorials

1. [Introduction to Quantum Computing for Artists](https://francisbitonti.blog/posts/quantum_gen_p1/)
    - Understanding quantum computing fundamentals
    - The potential impact on generative design
    - Overview of quantum principles for creative applications

2. Quantum Turtle Graphics (Part 2)
    - Visualization of quantum states using turtle graphics
    - Implementation of quantum random walks
    - Creating quantum-inspired generative art
    - Two key examples demonstrating quantum principles:
      - Single Quantum Turtle: Demonstrates superposition and measurement
      - Entangled Turtles: Shows quantum entanglement and correlation

## Code Examples

### 1. Quantum Turtle
The `quantum_turtle.py` module demonstrates basic quantum computing concepts through visual art:
- Quantum superposition
- Quantum measurement
- Quantum randomness
- Visual representation of quantum states

### 2. Entangled Turtles
The `entangled_turtles.py` module visualizes quantum entanglement:
- Bell state creation
- Perfect quantum correlation
- "Spooky action at a distance"
- Synchronized quantum measurements

Both examples use turtle graphics to create mesmerizing patterns that help visualize these quantum phenomena in an intuitive and artistic way.
